			<h1></h1>Simple reason ive fallen behind....
			<br>
			<p>I have simply fallen behind due to not having enuf time in the day or support that encourages me to succeed.</p>
            <h3>How will I address this problem....</h3>
			<p>I think the problem will work its self out in time with consistant effort and a better dedication to studying.</p>
			<h3>Am i capable of being able to continue learning with all things considered?</h3>
            <p>Considering people do this all day everyday their is no real reason to think i cant excel thru this.</p>
            <h3>In a nut sheel.</h3>
	        <p>Im just a old dog learning new tricks and in time my stubbornness should adapt to helping me instead of 
            <p>hindering me.</p>
